# Local Fruits & Veg

Local Fruits & Veg is a marketplace application that allows users to advertise products that come from their garden so that other people can see those and contact the advertising user.

This aims at increasing local production and consumption of food and reducing food waste locally in our gardens and allotments.

To run this app, clone the repo and run `bundle install`.  Then, run `shotgun` to start a server. Finally copy the link that appears on your terminal and paste it in your web browser.

### Prerequisites
